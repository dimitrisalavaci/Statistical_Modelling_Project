# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
- Gather data
- Analyze the data
- Make comparisons between two different data sets
- Join two different data sets together
- Build regression models to determine whether or not there is a relationship between one or more variables and what type of relationship it is

## Process
- Step 1: Pick a city from CityBikes API and query information on bike stations in that city
- Step 2: Connect to Foursquare and Yelp APIs and retrieve data of certain POIs 
- Step 3: Join all the data I found in steps 1 and 2 and explore it using methods of data visualization
- Step 4: Build a regression model that shows a relationship between two variables
- Step 5: Talk about challenges I faced
- Step 6: Talk about future goals and what more could've been done if I had more time

## Results
- I found that CityBikes, Yelp and Foursquare didn't have much information in my city of choice
- On the other hand, there were many points of interest(bars, restaurants, pubs) that were in the same areas
- I learned that in the city I chose, there were lots of POIs near the bike stations, the ratings of the POIs were dependant on the number of reviews they got
- The more reviews a restaurant got, it seemed like it was a lot more accurate compared to restaurants with less reviews
- The actual area I chose ended up being quite a small area that had a large amount of POIs or there were just a lot of POIs that were close together distance wise

## Challenges 
- This was a tough for me, due to the week I had I wasn't 100% mentally there and it was quite obvious that I was just messing up the simple stuff and getting errors that I normally never do
- One difficulty was choosing the city from citybikes API, it was weird because the big cities I picked like Madrid, Barcelona, London, New York, would all give me errors and then I would pick a city that worked but had almost 0 data to work with so that took an unnecessary amount of time
- Another difficulty was getting the Yelp API to work, kept googling and try different things but I couldn't seem to get the data from the API and that part also took up a lot of my time
- Finally the last difficulty I had was with Part 3 of the assignment, making the database and importing the data. I didn't realize it but I had done it and it was hidden and every time I tried to select all the data and view nothing would pop up and I would get frustated and after a while of trouble shooting, I had deleted the database 3 times already and the 4th time I made it I finally realized that it was hidden so that made me feel even worse, would've saved me a whole day.

## Future Goals
- I would definitely look into getting better data, it felt like it was a bit difficult to relate this data to each other specifically, I think maybe my choice of City had a part to play in that but it was one of the only cities that wouldn't giving me an error when running the code.
